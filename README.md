# 🍎 My First Apple-Based Code

This repository contains **my very first Apple-based program**.

I’m just getting started with the Apple ecosystem, learning **Swift / SwiftUI**, and exploring how iOS apps are built. This project represents my **first step** into that journey.

## 🚀 About This Project

* Built as a beginner project
* Focused on understanding Apple app development basics
* Written while learning Swift and SwiftUI

This is not a perfect or complete application — it’s a **learning milestone**.

## 🌱 Future Vision

In the future, I aim to:

* Build fully functional iOS applications
* Improve UI/UX using SwiftUI
* Work with real devices and simulators
* Eventually have my **own running machine (MacBook / Apple system)** to develop and test apps professionally

This project will always remind me where I started.

## ✨ Note to Future Me

Everyone starts somewhere. This is just the beginning.
Consistency > Perfection.
